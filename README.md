# My personal forge of Bioconductor related objects

This repository contains the code and the required information to generate customized Bioconductor (`BSgenome`, `EnsDb`, `TxDb`, ...) packages.

Use cases: you are looking exactly for one version, and that one is not available. 
Or you don't want to discard everything which is not in the regular chromosomes - if you used e.g. `seqlevelsStyle`

Here, I try to document every step of the process to generate, build, check, and install these packages.

## Packages

- `BSgenome.Mmusculus.ENSEMBL.GRCm38`, a.k.a. Full genome sequences for Mus Musculus (Mouse) as provided by ENSEMBL (GRCm38, release 92 from ENSEMBL)

## Contribute your own

If you think it would be reasonable to add other similar packages, well documented Pull Requests are very welcome!
